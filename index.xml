      <description>Hi, everyone!
If you came here you are probably thinking about hire me, follow and support my work or just stalking&amp;hellip;
No matter what reason, you came to the right place.
This is my personal website, where I plan do share some of my work, projects I&amp;rsquo;ve been to and my passions: bycicles, tech and books!
This site is not supposed to be updated regularly, whenever I feel I should update it, I will.</description>

      <description>I am a Software Engineer with more than ten years of experience in a multitude of environments and technologies, including digital television, software auditing, Microsoft technologies, full-stack web development and ElasticSearch.
As a hobby I like to be involved in Data Intelligence projects, working on all steps from Exploratory Data Analysis to Predictive Models, Machine Learning and beautiful Visualizations.
I enjoy living different experiences in life and work, and I see computer science as an instrument to improve people&amp;rsquo;s lives through the use of technology and a wonderful user experience.</description>
